# -Image_Classification-using-CNN
A Deep Learning Project on Image Recognition

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 images across 10 distinct categories, such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more.


 About CIFAR-10 Dataset
*CIFAR-10 is a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks in machine learning and computer vision.

*It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 different classes.

*The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

*Common classes include airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

*CIFAR-10 is frequently used for evaluating the performance of deep learning algorithms in image classification.


 Why Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)?
*CNNs are specifically designed for image-related tasks as they can capture spatial hierarchies in data.

*Convolution layers automatically extract features like edges, textures, and patterns from images.

*Pooling layers help in reducing the dimensionality and computation.

*CNNs are robust to translation and deformation of objects in images, making them ideal for datasets like CIFAR-10.
